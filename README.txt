---Fork MergeSort---
---Stephanie Lascola---

Overview: 
   This is an interprocess communication implementation of the traditional
   Mergesort algorithm. Instead of using arrays, this demonstrates the 
   complexity of sorting using pipes and forking. 

--IF RUNNING--
	Run with caution: forking can be potentially harmful to a computer.

To compile:
   Run the "make" in the terminal.
